# Examples

Here you can find examples using the library.
You can try it with node:

```
node test.js
```

Or you can open `index.html` in the browser.
The javascript in the browser is bundled with `browserify`.
If you want to make changes to the sources you can recreate the bundle with:

```
browserify test.js -o test.bundle.js
```
